A web application created with R's ShinyApps library designed to find the cell-type specific stemnesses in a spatial transcriptomics (ST) dataset. It uses our "Method 4" algorithm, which utilizes local constant kernel regression and quadratic programming to deconvolute spot-level stemnesses. Developed with Dr. Ziyi Li at MD Anderson Cancer Center.
